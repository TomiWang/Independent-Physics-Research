Cryogenics, a topic in physics that studies what happens to things (e.g. materials or living organisms) when the environment is at very low temperatures. Typically below -150C or -238F.
Dark matter is a mysterious form of matter that does not emit, absorb, or reflect light making it undetectable by instruments. However, we know of its existance by indirectly detecting it through its
gravitational effects on regular matter. it's believed to make up 27% of the universe's total mass and energy.
For this analysis project, I will be focusing on how cryogenics play a role in the search for dark matter!
Our main focus will be on Quantum Cryogenics as it is a key method for technological advancement, offering the ability to detect weak signals from dark matter by minimizing thermal noise and environmental interferences.
First. Quantum means the smallest individual packet of energy or matter (subatomic particles) and their behaviour is rather unpredictable.
In this post, I will first go over how quantum cryogenics enhances dark matter detection through theoretical concepts, practical challenges, and experimental methods to later create theoretical simulations
and practical modeling.

Theorems:
1. Boltzmann Distribution for Particle Interactions
   The particle interactions of dark matter follow a probability distribution governed by the Boltzmann equation f(v) ‚àù exp (-(mv^2)/(2kbT))
   Where:
        f(v) is the function of velocity distribution of particles.
        m is the mass of the particle.
        v is the velocity of the particle.
        kb is Boltzmann constant.
        
   Cryogenics will
