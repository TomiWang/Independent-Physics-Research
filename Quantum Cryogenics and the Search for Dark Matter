Cryogenics, a topic in physics studying what happens to things (e.g. materials or living organisms) when the environment is at very low temperatures. Typically below -150C or -238F.
Dark matter is a mysterious form of matter that does not emit, absorb, or reflect light making it undetectable by instruments. However, we know of its existance by indirectly detecting it through its gravitational effects on regular matter. it's believed to make up
27% of the universe's total mass and energy.
For this blog, I will be focusing on how cryogenics play a role in the search for dark matter!
